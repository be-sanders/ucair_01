#summary UCAIR's C++ template engine

= Introduction =

Anyone who has ever written embedded HTML in their C++/Perl programs can tell you how ugly and unmanageable the code can become. Luckily there are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_%28web%29 web page template engines] that allows one to separate the presentation logic (HTML pages) from application logic (data & algorithms). Examples include JSP for Java and [http://genshi.edgewall.org Genshi] for Python. But for C++, there is no really good choice: [http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/ Google's ctemplate] is overly simple (it provides no control logic such as branching and repeating). [http://teng.sourceforge.net teng] is more powerful (of course, still much inferior to JSP/Genshi due to C++'s limitations), but I want something simpler, easier, and under my full control :) So I came up with this small two-file library, though I must say the inspiration largely comes from teng.
