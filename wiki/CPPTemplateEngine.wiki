#summary UCAIR's C++ template engine

= Introduction =

Anyone who has ever tried mixing HTML code in their C++/Perl programs can tell you how ugly and unmanageable it can become. Luckily people have invented [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_%28web%29 web page template engines] that allows one to separate the presentation (HTML pages) from content (data & algorithms). Examples include JSP for Java and [http://genshi.edgewall.org Genshi] for Python. But for C++, there is no functionally equivalent templating engines: [http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/ Google's ctemplate] is way too simple (it provides no control logic such as branching and repeating). [http://teng.sourceforge.net teng] provides much more power, but I want something simpler, easier, and under my full control :) So I came up with this small two-file C++ template engine library, though I must say the inspiration large comes from teng.
