#summary Running the binary on Windows.

= Introduction =

If you have not installed Visual C++, you may need to download [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en VC runtime]. Note there is an x86 and x64 version.

After you click on run.bat, you can open a browser window (FF 3 suggested, IE8 may work, other browsers are not supported) and type http://localhost:8080/search

If you don't see anything, try to run run.bat in DOS window to see if there is any error message, and check your firewall settings.

You may change config.ini for settings such as port number.

To close just shut down the DOS window.

= TODO =

I need to make an installer and make it into a background process.
