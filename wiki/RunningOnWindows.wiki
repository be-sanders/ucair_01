#summary Running the binary on Windows.

If you have not installed Visual C++, you may need to download [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en VC 2008 runtime]. Note there is an x86 and x64 version.

After you run UCAIR.exe, you can open a browser window (Firefox 3 and IE 8 are recommended. Other browsers may or may not work) and type <h3>http://localhost:8080/</h3>

The server only listens to internal traffic (outside hosts cannot connect), so it should not pose a security risk.

In IE, you may get an information bar saying "Intranet settings are now turned off by default". You can safely select "do not show this again". For details, check [http://www.vexentricity.com/?p=61 here].

There is a log file in the program files folder that may help you diagnose problem.

*Currently UCAIR's "start up with Windows" does not work with UAC on Vista and Windows 7. You'll have to click on "UCAIR.exe" in the Programs Folder to start UCAIR server manually (before you can go to http://localhost:8080)*
