#summary Running the binary on Windows.

= Introduction =

If you have not installed Visual C++, you may need to download [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en VC 2008 runtime]. Note there is an x86 and x64 version.

After you click on run.bat, you can open a browser window (FF 3 suggested, IE8 may work, other browsers are not supported) and type http://localhost:8080/search

The server only listens to internal traffic (outside hosts cannot connect), so it should not pose a security risk.

In IE, you may get an information bar saying "Intranet settings are now turned off by default". You can safely select "do not show this again". For details, check [http://www.vexentricity.com/?p=61 here].

If you don't see anything, try to run run.bat in DOS window to see if there is any error message, and check your firewall settings.

You may change config.ini for settings such as port number.

To close just shut down the DOS window.

= TODO =

I need to make an installer and make it into a background process.
